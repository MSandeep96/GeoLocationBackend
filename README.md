# Almost Real Time Location Tracking

The app lets random user's share their location. It also lets user's track online status.

The online status tracking is done on the front end. It uses polling and an O(n) algorithm to track user's online status.

Built on top of Node.js and React. The app doesn't use Socket.io.
